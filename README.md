# 🛠️ 100 Days of DevOps

Welcome to my **100 Days of DevOps** challenge!
The goal of this challenge is to learn, practice, and document DevOps concepts, tools, and practices over the next 100 days.

---

## 📌 Challenge Rules

* I will spend **at least 1 hour every day** on DevOps-related learning/practice.
* I will document my daily progress in this repository.
* Each day will have:

  * A **notes.md** file with explanations, commands, and references.
  * A **script/config file** (if applicable) that implements the day’s task.
